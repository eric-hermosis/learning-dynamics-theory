This work presents a fundamental theory of artificial learning, providing a unifying framework for understanding and designing optimization algorithms. It interprets learning as a thermodynamic process, where models evolve according to the information they receive. Using geometric and Hamiltonian formalisms, we derive evolution equations that describe this process and offer a physically grounded perspective on learning dynamics.
